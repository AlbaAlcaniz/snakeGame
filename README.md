# snakeGame

This repository is my first experiment with python games. It all started one day when I wanted to play Snake. For good old times. Since I didn't have the game, I decided to program it (the easiest solution, right?). Then I discovered I had no idea where to start, so I looked for and watched an hour video on Youtube which programmed and explained step by step how to do the snake game on python. So I did.
PD: Just after finishing, I discovered that if you google "snake game" google has the game. I like to take the challenging paths. But it felt nice playing a game which I knew how it worked internally.

Once finished the game, I thought about some additional features: adding walls so that the game would be more difficult, add apples (or snacks, how the guy called them) which made you decrease in size, instead of increase in size, etc. But the next day was a Monday, and I got busy with my MSc thesis.

The day after my thesis defence, I decided to retake the game where I had left it. So I started playing around, and I added all the improvements I could think of. I know the code is not perfect; I know that it sometimes crashes without any apparent reason (I'm pretty sure the game has some reason to crash, but it's just too shy to tell me); I know that the game is not efficient; and, since I also know myself, it's very likely that I have a lack of some comments. But practice makes perfect, right? Next games will be better!! :D
