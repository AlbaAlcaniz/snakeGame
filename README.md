# snakeGame

This repository is my first experiment with python games. It all started one day when I wanted to play Snake and I decided to program it. Then I discovered I had no idea where to start, so I looked for and watched an hour video on Youtube which programmed and explained step by step how to do the snake game on python. So I did.

Once finished the game, I thought about some additional features: adding walls so that the game would be more difficult, add rotten apples which made you decrease in size, instead of increase in size, etc. So I started playing around, and I added all the improvements I could think of. 

I know the code is not perfect nor efficient. But due to it, I have learned good practices in Python, how to use GitHub, and improved my knowledge of object-oriented programming.
