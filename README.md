# snakeGame

This repository is my first experiment with python games. It all started one day when I wanted to play Snake and I decided to program it. Then I discovered I had no idea where to start, so I looked for and watched an hour video on Youtube which programmed and explained step by step how to do the snake game on python. So I did.

Once finished the game, I thought about some additional features: adding walls so that the game would be more difficult, add rotten apples which made you decrease in size, instead of increase in size, etc. So I started playing around, and I added all the improvements I could think of. 

You can compare those two files. The simple original one with the code copied from internet, and my code based on that one with all the additional features.

I know that the code can be improved, but thanks to it, I have learned good practices in Python, how to use GitHub, and improved my knowledge of object-oriented programming.
